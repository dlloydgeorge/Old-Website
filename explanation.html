            This is a game designed to illustrate how dynamical decoupling (sequences of pulses) can reduce decoherence in a qubit and extend its lifetime.
                A qubit is the fundamental unit of quantum computation, analagous to a bit in classical computation. It is represented by a two state quantum system. 
                An arbitary state of a qubit can be represented by a statevector of the following form: 
                $$ \ket{\psi} = \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1} $$
            This state can be generalized to a density matrix that allows for the consideration of mixed states. The state $\ket{\psi}$ can be written out as the following density matrix: 
                $$ \rho = \ket{\psi} \bra{\psi} $$
            We can solve for the general evolution of the density matrix using the master equation/ GKSL equation ($\hbar = 1$):
            $$ \dot{\rho} = - i [H, \rho]  + \sum_i \gamma_i \left( L_i \rho L^{\dagger}_i + \frac{1}{2} \left \{  L_i^{\dagger } L_i, \rho \right\}\right)$$
            where $L_i $ are the lindbladian/jump operators that represent the dissipative dynamics associated with the interaction of a qubit with its environment. We would like to solve this equation to find the dynamics of the qubit however we first need a way to visualize the qubit. For single qubit quantum state, we can represent an arbitrary density matrix with the following form: 
            $$ \rho = \frac{1}{2} (I + \vec{r}\cdot \vec{\sigma})$$
            Where $\vec{r}$ represents the amplitude associated with each pauli matrix. We can plot $\vec{r}$ as a 3d vector on the bloch sphere, visualizing it in the process. We would ideally like to reexpress the GKSL equation in terms of $\vec{r}$ as that is ultimately what is used for plotting. We can start by solving for this with the GKSL with no dissipative dynamics and representing the qubit hamiltonian as a linear combination of pauli matrices: 
            $$\hat{H} = h_0 I + \vec{h}\cdot \vec{\sigma} \qquad 
                \dot{\rho} = - i [\hat{H}, \rho] 
            $$
